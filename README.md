# DatabaseTechniquesFinalProject
This is a website I built for my database techniques class.  It includes a frontend website along with a backend database to store information for the website.  I used XAMPP control panel to run this locally (Docker image coming soon).

In my project, I had the mysqli_connect.php script outside of htdocs so some edits might be needed to set up the website.
