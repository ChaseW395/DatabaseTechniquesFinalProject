# DatabaseTechniquesFinalProject
This is a website I built for my database techniques class.  It includes a website along with a backend database to store information.  I used XAMPP control panel to run this locally (Docker image coming soon).  


Admin Credentials:

Email: admin@admin.com - Password: password

In my project, I had the mysqli_connect.php script outside of htdocs so some edits might be needed to set up the website.

There are a few areas that could have better security, especially when it comes to password logging and logins.  I did not use salts in the password hash.  I may go back and update this website with some new features, but this project focused mainly on the database system and connecting it to the website, not security.
